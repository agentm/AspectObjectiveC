This is still pre alpha, so it's highly unstable. It is however
usable at the moment if you want to try it out. Build the framework
target then install it as a private framework in another app to take
it for a spin. 

I've only tested it with gcc on i386, so you may find that it doesn't
work with anything else at the moment. If you've got a different setup,
run the unit tests. If the tests pass then you're probably ok.
